        Welcome to my webpage! I'm excited to share my passion for technology and
 outline my goals for the next two years in the ever-evolving world of frontend development.
 <br>
       For me, code isn't just lines on a screen; it's the power to create innovative solutions and user 
experiences that can make a real difference. <br> My ultimate aim here is to leverage the power of frontend 
development to build an application that tackles a pressing issue and improves lives in today's world.
<br>
But the journey to get to that point requires continuous learning and a lot of researches.
 Here's what I'm focusing on over the next 24 months:
    </p>
    
         <!--Listed items in Unordered list-->
        <ul class="listings">
        <li>
            Building Beautiful and Functional Interfaces: I'll be diving deeper into UI frameworks like Bootstrap to create user interfaces that are not only visually appealing but also intuitive and user-friendly. Responsive design is key, which is why I am ensuring my creations adapt seamlessly across desktops, mobiles, and tablets.
        </li>
        <li>
            Making  User Experience (UX) my priority: I'm actively learning about information architecture, navigation 
design, and user flow to craft websites and applications that are easy to navigate. Overtime I will carry out simple surveys or interviews to
 improve on User experience
        </li>
        <li>
            Mastering and Understanding Modern Tech Tools: Frontend frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js are on my radar. These powerful tools will allow me to build
             dynamic and interactive experiences. Additionally, JavaScript fluency (including ES6 features) and familiarity with build
             tools like Webpack or Parcel are essential companions in this journey. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Collaboration and Version Control: Git is my weapon of choice for version control and collaborating with fellow developers. Tracking changes, making commits, working seamlessly with others, and the ability to revert to previous versions are all crucial aspects of a smooth development workflow.
        </li>
        <li>
            Deployment and Taking it Live: The journey doesn't end with development. I'm exploring platforms like Netlify, Vercel, and Github Pages to confidently deploy my creations to the web, 
making them accessible to the world.This is just the beginning! I'm excited to keep learning, building, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.  Feel free to reach out and connect with me
 on this journey.  Together, we can leverage technology to make a positive impact on the world!
